## About the Program
The program’s learning objectives and demanding, hands-on courses are designed around employer needs. Throughout their time in the program, students build portfolios of increasingly complex projects using popular programming languages such as R and Python, which mirror the current experience and demands of the workplace. Students build predictive and prescriptive models, practice giving presentations, and review each other’s work in a convenient online setting, ensuring that they are equipped with the expertise most valued in today’s marketplace. The MS in Data Science program culminates with a capstone project that represents highly sophisticated, but practical, solutions to address real world problems.

## Disciplines Covered
- **Probability and statistics**: Descriptive statistics, sampling techniques, discrete probability models, sampling, statistical distributions, correlation, and null hypothesis testing
- **Applied math**: Matrix manipulation, linear equations, and loss functions
- **Programming**: Creating, testing and optimizing regression, classification, and Bayesian models using R and Python
- **Data acquisition and management**: Acquiring/importing data frames; cleaning, normalizing, and manipulating data via SQL
- **Critical thinking and communication**: Framing real-world phenomena as quantitative representations and explaining results in simple, clear, and cogent language
