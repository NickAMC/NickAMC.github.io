## Exercise 1

Explore the following four time series: Bricks from aus_production, Lynx from pelt, Close from gafa_stock, Demand from vic_elec.

* Use ? (or help()) to find out about the data in each series.

* What is the time interval of each series?



```{r}
bricks <- aus_production |> 
  select(Bricks)

lynx <- pelt |> 
  select(Lynx)

close <- gafa_stock |> 
  select(Close)

demand <- vic_elec |> 
  select(Demand)
```

The time intervals of each series:
 
 * Bricks is quarterly
 
```{r}
head(bricks)

```
 
 * Lynx is yearly

```{r}
head(lynx)
```

 * Close is daily

```{r}
close <- close |> mutate(Date = as_date(Date)) |> 
  as_tsibble(index = Date)

head(close)
```

 * Demand is every 30 mins

```{r}
head(demand)
```


* Use autoplot() to produce a time plot of each series.

* For the last plot, modify the axis labels and title.

### Bricks, Lynx, Close, and Demand {.tabset}

#### Bricks 

```{r}
autoplot(bricks, Bricks)
```

```{r}
autoplot(bricks, Bricks) + 
  labs(title="Quarterly Bricks Production (AUS)",
       x= "Quarter",
       y= "# of Bricks Produced (Millions)") +
  theme_minimal()
```

#### Lynx 

```{r}
autoplot(lynx, Lynx)
```

```{r}
autoplot(lynx, Lynx) +
  labs(title = "Lynx Data", 
       x= "Year (Annual)", 
       y = "Number of Lynx Pelt Traded") +
  theme_minimal()
```


#### Close 

```{r}
autoplot(close, Close)
```

```{r}
autoplot(close, Close) +
  labs(title = "Daily Closing Stock Price",
       x="Daily", 
       y = "Closing Stock Price ($)") + 
  theme_minimal()
```

#### Demand 

```{r}
autoplot(demand, Demand)
```

```{r}
autoplot(demand,Demand) + 
  labs(title = "Electricity Demand in Victoria, Australia ", 
       x = "Every Half Hour",
       y = "Electricity Demand (Mhw)") + 
  theme_minimal()
```


## Exercise 2 

First, we need to group the data by `Symbol` so then we can filter `Close` to have the maximum or peak closing price for each stock. We then select the columns we want to see which are `Date`, `Symbol`, and `Close`.

```{r}
close |> 
  group_by(Symbol) |> 
  filter(Close == max(Close)) |> 
  select(Date, Symbol, Close)

# fidn the days where the closing price was at its peak i.e. max
```

## Exercise 3 

Code provided by textbook. We downloaded the tute1.csv file and used view() to examine the data. Using the as_tsibble() function, we convert the data to a time series where the time interval is quarterly setting the index to `Quarter`. Plotting the timeseries a line plot using ggplot() and geom_line() and utilized facet_grid() to create a subgrid of the timeseries. 

### Parts {.tabset}

#### a. 
You can read the data into R with the following script:

```{r}
tute1 <- readr::read_csv("tute1.csv")
#View(tute1)
```

#### b. 
Convert the data to time series 

```{r}
mytimeseries <- tute1 |>
  mutate(Quarter = yearquarter(Quarter)) |>
  as_tsibble(index = Quarter)
```

#### c. 

Construct time series plots of each of the three series

```{r}
mytimeseries |>
  pivot_longer(-Quarter) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = Quarter, y = value, colour = name)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_grid(name ~ ., scales = "free_y")
```
```{r}
mytimeseries |>
  pivot_longer(-Quarter) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = Quarter, y = value, colour = name)) +
  labs(title = "No facet_grid()") +
  geom_line() 
```

Check what happens when you donâ€™t include facet_grid().

## Exercise 4 

First, we install the package USgas and converted Usgas to a timeseries using as_tsibble() and setting the index to `year` and key to `state`. Afterwards, we wanted to see the gas consumption for the following states; Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachussetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island. To do that using the filter() function and used autoplot() to visualize the timeseries.

#### Install the USgas package.

```{r}
#install.packages("USgas")
library(USgas)
```

#### Create a tsibble from us_total with year as the index and state as the key.

```{r}
head(us_total)
```

```{r}
us_total <- us_total |> 
  as_tsibble(index = year, key = state)
head(us_total)
```

#### Plot the annual natural gas consumption by state for the New England area (comprising the states of Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island).

```{r}
filtered_us_total <- us_total |> 
  filter(state %in% c("Maine", "Vermont", "New Hamposhire", "Massachusetss", "Connecticut", "Rhode Island")) 

autoplot(filtered_us_total, y ) +
  labs(title='US Annual Total Natural Gas Consumption', 
       x = "Year", 
       y = "Total Natural Gas Consumption (MMcf") +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Exercise 5


Using read_excel() from readxl package to load in the data, in order to create a tsibble object that is identical to the tourism tsibble from the tsibble package. Created the tourism tsibble object with setting the index to Quarter, a timeseries with quarterly time interval, and setting the key to `Region`, `State`, and `Purpose` to mimic the original tourism tsibble. Then, we wanted find which combination of `Region` and `Purpose` had the highest average of overnight trips. We did that by first grouping the timeseries by the `Region` and `Purpose` then using summarize() to calculate the mean() of `Trips`. Next, filtered the timeseries for the max overnight trips of each possible combination. FInally, arranged() the output in descending order to show the the combination with the highest average of overnight trips. 

#### Download tourism.xlsx from the book website and read it into R using readxl::read_excel().

```{r}
library(readxl)
data <- read_excel('tourism.xlsx')
```

#### Create a tsibble which is identical to the tourism tsibble from the tsibble package.

```{r}
head(tourism) # tourism from the tsibble package
```

```{r}
tourism_2 <- data |> 
  mutate(Quarter = yearquarter(Quarter)) |> 
  as_tsibble(index = Quarter, key = c(Region, State, Purpose))

head(tourism_2)
```

#### Find what combination of Region and Purpose had the maximum number of overnight trips on average.

```{r}
tourism_2 |> 
  group_by(Region, Purpose) |> 
  summarize(AverageTrips = mean(Trips, na.rm = TRUE)) |> 
  filter(AverageTrips == max(AverageTrips)) |> 
  arrange(desc(AverageTrips)) |> head()
```

#### Create a new tsibble which combines the Purposes and Regions, and just has total trips by State.

```{r}
tourism_2 |> 
  group_by(State) |> 
  summarize(TotalTrips = sum(Trips)) |> 
  as_tsibble(index = Quarter) |> 
  head()
  
```



## Exercise 8 {.tabset}

Created a function that will generate the following plots each timeseries input, autoplot(), gg_season(), gg_subseries(), gg_lag(), and ACF(), since we will be performing similar operation on multiple timeseries. While answering the following question: 

* Can you spot any seasonality, cyclicity and trend?

* What do you learn about the series?

* What can you say about the seasonal patterns?

* Can you identify any unusual years?

```{r}
plot_time_series <- function(data) {
  
  p1 <- autoplot(data) + theme_minimal()
  
  p2 <- gg_season(data) + theme_minimal()
  
  p3 <- gg_subseries(data) + theme_minimal()
  
  p4 <- gg_lag(data, geom = "point") + theme_minimal()
  
  p5 <- ACF(data) |> 
    autoplot() + theme_minimal()
  
  print(p1)
  print(p2)
  print(p3)
  print(p4)
  print(p5)
}
```

```{r}
plot_time_series_without_gg_season <- function(data) {
  
  p1 <- autoplot(data) + theme_minimal()
  
  p3 <- gg_subseries(data) + theme_minimal()
  
  p4 <- gg_lag(data, geom = "point") + theme_minimal()
  
  p5 <- ACF(data) |> 
    autoplot() + theme_minimal()
  
  print(p1)
  print(p3)
  print(p4)
  print(p5)
}
```

### Time Series : {.tabset}

#### us_employment

* Can you spot any seasonality, cyclicity and trend?

Overall, this time series has only linearly increasing trend. Some may argue that there may be a seasonal aspect to it when taking a look at the peaks and valleys generated from autoplot() but looking at gg_season() plot it is almost perfect parallel line indicating little to no seasonality. Look the plots, we can say that job growth in private sector in the US has been linearly increasing over the years. It seems that the years 2001 and 2008 had impacts on job growth where we a decrease in the number of employed in the private sector. Moreover, there is a strongt positive correlation between lag as n is from 1 to 9 due the general increasing trend of the timeseries. 


```{r}
total_private <- us_employment |> 
  filter(Title == "Total Private") |> select(Month, Employed)
```

```{r}
print(plot_time_series(total_private))
```


#### aus_production

From 1960 - 1970s, there is an increased trend of bricks production in Australia. Then, that trend starts decreasing in the 1980s. The plots do not suggest any cyclic behavior but I suspect there exists some seasonality within each quarter. The plots supports my suspicion of a strong seasonality in the time series with its strong positive correlation from lag 1 to 9.


```{r}
print(plot_time_series(bricks))
```

#### pelt

This timeseries demonstrates neither an increasing nor decreasing trend but rather a cyclic pattern. Now, taking a look the lag plots there is no obvious correlation from prior time intervals. Moreover, the ACF() plots supports the observation that this time series exhibits cyclical behavior.


```{r}
hare <- pelt |> select(-Lynx) |> as_tsibble(index = Year)
```

```{r}
print(plot_time_series_without_gg_season(hare))
```

gg_season() doesnt work on this particular time series since a season suggest sub-yearly data. 

#### PBS

PBS time series exhibits a somewhat increasing trend along with a seasonal patterns where cost is usually at its peak during December. From this time series, we learned that Australian presciption cost is at its lowest in the month of February, repeating for each consecutive years.  

```{r}
h02 <- PBS |> 
  filter(ATC2 == "H02") |> 
  as_tibble() |> 
  select(Month, Cost) |> 
  group_by(Month) |> 
  summarize(Cost = sum(Cost)) |> 
  as_tsibble(index = Month)
```

```{r}
print(plot_time_series(h02))
```

#### us_gasoline

Us_gasoline time series increasing trend with a seasonal pattern. When inspecting the lag plot, all 52 weeks are closely grouped together along the positive correlation line indicating that us gas price generally increase every year. Then, this is supported by AFC() plot where the values are all above 0.50 correlation.

```{r}
print(plot_time_series(us_gasoline))
```
