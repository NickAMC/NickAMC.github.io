## Introduction 

In my Data Science Master's program at CUNY, I've progressed through a comprehensive curriculum that covered exploratory data analysis, the foundational math including linear algebra, probability, statistics, and calculus, and practical skills in data collection and wrangling. I've developed proficiency in feature engineering and selection, and gained hands-on experience in building and selecting models, focusing on regression and classification techniques. This journey has given me a well-rounded skill set in data science, preparing me for real-world challenges.

## Undergraduate

BS in Mathematics 

Concentration: Applied Math

## About the Program

The program’s learning objectives and demanding, hands-on courses are designed around employer needs. Throughout their time in the program, students build portfolios of increasingly complex projects using popular programming languages such as R and Python, which mirror the current experience and demands of the workplace. Students build predictive and prescriptive models, practice giving presentations, and review each other’s work in a convenient online setting, ensuring that they are equipped with the expertise most valued in today’s marketplace. The MS in Data Science program culminates with a capstone project that represents highly sophisticated, but practical, solutions to address real world problems.

The program covers a broad range of disciplines:  

* Probability and statistics: descriptive statistics, sampling techniques, discrete probability models, sampling, statistical distributions, correlation, and null hypothesis testing 
* Applied math: matrix manipulation, linear equations, and loss functions 
* Programming: creating, testing and optimizing regression, classification, and Bayesian models using R and Python 
* Data acquisition and management: acquiring/importing data frames; cleaning, normalizing, and manipulating data via SQL 
* Critical thinking and communication: framing real-world phenomena as quantitative representations and explaining results in simple, clear, and cogent language

## Projects

- **[Analysis on Global Electricity Demand]([link-to-project](https://rpubs.com/nick_clim04/1039314))**:
  This was my very first project in this program where I used R to to perform statistical analysis to determine if there exists significant difference between developed and developing nations.
