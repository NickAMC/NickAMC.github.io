## Welcome to My Data Science Portfolio
In my Data Science Master’s program at CUNY, I’ve progressed through a comprehensive curriculum that covered exploratory data analysis, the foundational math including linear algebra, probability, statistics, and calculus, and practical skills in data collection and wrangling. I’ve developed proficiency in feature engineering and selection, and gained hands-on experience in building and selecting models, focusing on regression and classification techniques. This journey has given me a well-rounded skill set in data science, preparing me for real-world challenges.

## Academic Projects

### [Predicting the PH of Beverages](https://github.com/NickAMC/NickAMC.github.io/tree/main/DATA_624_S24/project_2)

- Objective and Methods: Developed a predictive model for pH regulation in manufacturing processes using statistical methods and machine learning algorithms, including linear regression, random forests, SVM, and neural networks. Employed feature engineering and selection techniques to identify key predictors.

- Results: The random forest model achieved the highest predictive accuracy with an RMSE of 0.0949 and an R-squared of 0.7203. Key predictors identified included manufacturing flow, brand code, and usage context.

### [Time Series Forecasting for ATM Cash Withdrawal and Residential Power Consumption](https://nickamc.github.io/DATA_624_S24/project_1/atm_forecasting.html)

- Objective and Methods: Developed forecasts for cash withdrawals at four ATMs for May 2010 and residential power consumption for 2014 using time series analysis. Employed SARIMA and Exponential Smoothing models, performing thorough exploratory data analysis and data cleaning to ensure accurate predictions.

- Results: Achieved high accuracy in forecasting with SARIMA models for ATM1 and ATM2, Naive model for ATM3, and Holt-Winters model for ATM4. For residential power consumption, the Holt-Winters model provided the best performance, capturing seasonal variations effectively.


### [Predicting Wine Sales Using Machine Learning](https://nickamc.github.io/D622-S24/hw4/hw4.html)

- Objective and Methods: Developed models to predict wine sales using features such as acidity, sugar levels, and other chemical properties. Employed machine learning algorithms, including Support Vector Machine (SVR), Random Forest, XGBoost, and a Simple Neural Network. Handled missing data with various imputation methods, standardized the data, and used GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.

- Results: XGBoost achieved the best performance with an MSE of 2.217, RMSE of 1.489, and MAE of 1.166. Key features impacting wine sales were identified as STARS, LabelAppeal, and AcidIndex, providing actionable insights for enhancing sales strategies.
