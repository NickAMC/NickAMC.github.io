    "## Do stricter gun laws reduce firearm gun deaths?\n",
    "\n",
    "The CDC publishes firearm mortality for each State per 100,000 persons https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/sosmap/firearm_mortality/firearm.htm. Each State' firearm control laws can be categorized as very strict to very lax. \n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this Story is to answer the question, \" Do stricter firearm control laws help reduce firearm mortality?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment you will need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Access the firearm mortality data from the CDC using an available API (https://open.cdc.gov/apis.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create a 5 point Likert scale categorizing gun control laws from most lax to strictest and assign each state to the most appropriate Likert bin.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Determine wether stricter gun control laws result in reduced gun violence deaths\n",
    "\n",
    "Present your story using  heat maps\n",
    "Notes:\n",

    "You may not use the same desktop application that you have used for a previous story.\n",
